<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The MathJax Inline Equation and MathJax Block Equation macros use
the <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax Javascript Library</a>
to create equations in a modern web browser. The library has
a lots of power; however, only some is presently exposed and working.
For example, the library can work with MathML and AsciiMath input;
however, the only input format which has been worked on is the Tex
input. Should the other input formats be desired, contact <a href="pdl-atlassian-plugin-development@globus.com">

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>The MathJax library scans the html looking for &quot;tagged&quot;
   sections. A tex equation to be displayed inline is &quot;tagged&quot;
   by starting with <strong>\[</strong> and ending with <strong>\]</strong>.
   A tex equation to be displayed centered on a new line should start
   with <strong>\(</strong> and end with <strong>\)</strong>. The inline
   and block MathJax macros simply wrap the equation with the appropriate
   tags. Therefore, it's possible to insert an inline or block equation
   without the macros just using the MathJax syntax. This is not advised
   as the macro can be searched for allowing system admins to understand
   the extent of the MathJax usage.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><strong>Equation</strong>: The equation in Tex format to display. (Inline Macro only)</p>
